	&lt;p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Project Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;This NSF AI Research Institute proposal addresses Theme 6A by proposing the INVITE Institute (INclusive and innoVative Intelligent Technologies for Education) to address the grand challenge of “Education for All”. Research will invent, investigate, and deploy novel AI-augmented learning technologies and foundational AI techniques to address the needs of learners who are underserved and underrepresented in STEM. INVITE seeks fundamental change in how educational technologies interact with learners by developing AI techniques that track and promote “non-cognitive” skills that contribute to academic success. INVITE brings together a highly interdisciplinary and internationally-recognized team of researchers with expertise in AI, the learning sciences, psychology, and broadening participation with a network of diverse schools, districts and community partners to pursue these critical challenges.&lt;p&gt;
