	&lt;p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Endurance sports such as cycling hold many benefits for physical and mental well-being. Furthermore, an abundance of research has established that physical activity with partners collaboratively holds many benefits compared to physical activity alone. In the Collaborative Sport project we are developing novel technologies that enable two or more people engaged in physical activity together to see each otherâ€™s data, such as heart rate, in real time.&lt;p&gt;
	
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Project Description&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;We have prototyped an app called Connexx which displays heart rate, pace, and other key metrics for runners, walkers, and cyclists during real-time collaborative physical activity. Connexx is prototyped for smartphones, smartwatches, and Karoo cycling computers. We are actively conducting research on how real-time analytics can facilitate the beneficial and complex social processes within collaborative physical activity and sport. 	&lt;p&gt;
