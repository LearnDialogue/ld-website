	&lt;p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Endurance sports such as cycling hold many benefits for physical and mental well-being. In cycling in particular, collaboration is an essential component of many athletesâ€™ training. Current technology does not support real-time analytics for collaboration, so cyclists operate on limited information about their collaborators. This project is investigating the ways in which real-time data can support cyclists in collaborating to meet their training goals. The same technology can support both athletes and casual cyclists in understanding the needs and exertion of their riding partners.&lt;p&gt;
	
	<!-- &lt;p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Project Description&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Project IntegrateAI will integrate AI learning through NLP into middle school science through participatory co-design with middle school teachers. Middle school science provides an excellent context for integrating NLP because of the focus on inquiry-oriented science and the value in being able to identify and use textual resources. Project IntegrateAI will bring potentially transformative learning experiences to middle school teachers and students: for teachers, we will support development of competencies (knowledge and skills around NLP and science; ethical reasoning) as well as achieve a sense of preparedness to bring authentic, inquiry-based NLP experiences into their science classrooms. For students, these innovative experiences will foster competencies (knowledge and skills around NLP and science; ethical reasoning) and attitudes toward STEM careers (interest, identity, and intention to persist).	&lt;p&gt; -->
