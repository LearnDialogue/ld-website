	&lt;p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Project Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Pedal Florida is a broad initiative to increase Floridians’ physical activity through outdoor social cycling. Within this initiative, we have undertaken a Florida Department of Health funded research study to benefit Florida’s citizens, who include more than 200,000 cancer survivors. Even after fighting their battle with cancer, these survivors continue to face increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Extensive research shows the benefits of physical activity in combatting these risks, yet many cancer survivors lead sedentary lives. We aim to increase physical activity and social connectedness with an innovative citizen-led mentoring approach focused on cycling, which is an excellent form of aerobic exercise for people of all ages. By focusing on outdoor cycling, the Pedal Florida initiative leverages the restorative power of spending time outdoors both on physical and mental wellness.&lt;p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Project Description&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;We are establishing a train-the-trainer style intervention to recruit and train new outdoor cyclists. By partnering with cancer survivors in citizen-led cycling clubs already in existence throughout the state, this intervention is intended to be self-sustaining at a low cost after it is well established. Long-term, the project aims to significantly improve cancer survivorship through increasing physical activity, reducing isolation, and doing both of those in restorative outdoor spaces. &lt;p&gt;
