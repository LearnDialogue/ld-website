	&lt;p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Project Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The AI-Powered Athletics project is a part of the partnership between the Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering (COE) and the University Athletic Association (UAA). This project is examining the needs of athletes, coaches, and staff for utilizing data to improve wellness and performance. It is also building an infrastructure to enable AI-powered athletics based on the wearable sensor, health, nutrition, and sports performance data of student-athletes. This project is also making novel advances in data privacy and security for student athletes.&lt;p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Project Description&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The AI-Powered Athletics project works with health, nutrition, and sports performance data collected by UAA - including wearable sensors from practices and games. While this data is greatly under-analyzed and under-utilized, our research teamâ€™s proposed treatment can produce significant benefits for team performance, student-athlete health, and well-being.  We will perform three project strands: organizing, distributing, and analyzing the rich UF student-athlete data; fully leveraging wearable sensors by building human-facing interfaces, which distill information in a way that improves performance and well-being; and providing pilot awards to faculty members across campus who propose scientific and/or educational research projects in collaboration with the research team.&lt;p&gt;
