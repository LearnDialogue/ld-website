	<tagline>AI-Empowered Athletics - Athletics based on the wearable sensor and health data of student-athletes</tagline>
	<description>
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Project Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The AI-Powered Athletics project is a part of the partnership between the Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering (COE) and the University Athletic Association (UAA). This project will help build an infrastructure to enable AI-powered athletics based on the wearable sensor and health data of student-athletes. Funded projects may generate pilot data and initial publications that lead to large-scale research proposals for federal agencies.&lt;p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Project Description&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The AI-Powered Athletics project works with health, nutrition, and sports performance data collected by UAA - including wearable sensors from practices and games. While this data is greatly under-analyzed and under-utilized, our research teamâ€™s proposed treatment can produce significant benefits for team performance, student-athlete health, and well-being.  We will perform three project strands: organizing, distributing, and analyzing the rich UF student-athlete data; fully leveraging wearable sensors by building human-facing interfaces, which distill information in a way that improves performance and well-being; and providing pilot awards to faculty members across campus who propose scientific and/or educational research projects in collaboration with the research team.&lt;p&gt;
