	<description>
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Project Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The AI-Powered Athletics initiative is a partnership between the Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering (COE) and the University Athletic Association (UAA). This project is examining the needs of athletes, coaches, and staff for utilizing data to improve wellness and performance. We are building a databank of wearable sensor, health, nutrition, and sports performance data of student-athletes, and making novel advances in data privacy and security for student athletes. &lt;p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Project Description&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The AI-Powered Athletics project works with health, nutrition, and sports performance data collected by UAA - including wearable sensors from practices and games. While this data is greatly under-analyzed and under-utilized, our research team’s proposed treatment can produce significant benefits for team performance, student-athlete health, and well-being. We will organize, distribute, and analyze the rich UF student-athlete data in close partnership with coaches, staff, and athletes themselves. We are investigating ways in which coaching staff and athletes leverage data to advance athletes’ and teams’ performance and wellbeing.&lt;p&gt;
