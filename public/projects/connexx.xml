	<tagline>ConneXX - Real-time biometric displays for collaboration in endurance sports</tagline>
	<description>
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Project Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The ConneXX project is a part of the partnership between the Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering (COE) and the College of Health and Human Performance (HHP). This project will help build a real time display to enable collaborative physical activity partners to view each other's biometrics (e.g., Heart Rate) in real time. Funded projects may generate pilot data and initial publications that lead to large-scale research proposals for federal agencies.&lt;p&gt;
