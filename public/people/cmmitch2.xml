	<bio>I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science advised by Dr. Kristy Elizabeth Boyer and 
	Dr. James C. Lester. In a broad sense, my research interests lie in artificial intelligence, 
	computational linguistics, dialogue systems, machine learning, and intelligent tutoring systems. 
	My current emphasis is on modeling effective tutorial dialogue behaviors in a task-oriented 
	environment, determining both the timing of dialogue moves and the type of dialogue moves that 
	are most conducive to learning.</bio>
