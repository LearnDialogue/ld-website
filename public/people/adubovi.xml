Current work:
&lt;br&gt;
Detecting Uncertainty in Spoken Responses:
&lt;br&gt;
The goal is to create an autonomous tutoring algorithm that will detect uncertainty in speech, and use that uncertainty to learn how to further proceed with the designated task. This research will help improve current automated tutoring systems, which holds the potential to increase the pass rate of large classes and create a more individual computer tutoring experience.
