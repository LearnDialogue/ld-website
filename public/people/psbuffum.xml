<bio>
A native Rhode Islander, I am now pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at NCSU under the guidance of Dr. Kristy Boyer. Before coming to NCSU, I studied Classics as an undergraduate at Brown University and then worked in urban education for several years, including two years serving with the National College Advising Corps. 
&lt;p&gt;My research interests lie in computer science education and in artificial intelligence. In computer science education, I am interested in the design of K-12 curricula that integrate computational thinking with other disciplines, equitable design, and in K-12 teacher development. In artificial intelligence, my research focuses on pedagogical agents and narrative-centered learning environments.&lt;/p&gt;
