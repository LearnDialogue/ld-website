		I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at North Carolina State University, working under a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship. My research interests lie in natural language processing of tutorial dialogue, examining how the speech of different student personalities and archetypes can act as an indicator of learning, engagement, and frustration, and how these groups of students react to different varieties of tutorial dialogue.
