<bio>
I am a Ph.D. student at North Carolina State University, advised by Dr. Kristy Elizabeth Boyer. I am working on dialogue management and natural language understanding for tutorial dialogue systems. My overall goal is to improve automated tutorial dialogue systems and natural language understanding by using data-driven approaches.
I am working on the JavaTutor Project, a natural language tutorial dialogue project for introductory computer science education.
