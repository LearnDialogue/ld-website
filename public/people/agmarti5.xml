	&lt;p&gt;I am a junior undergraduate student at Meredith College, 
	but I started doing research at the LearnDialogue group on May 2013. 
	My research work consists of developing curricula for projects that aim
	to take computer science education to middle school and elementary school classrooms. 
	It is a challenging and exciting process to create content where students will develop
	computational thinking skills while appreciating the social relevance of computer science. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;My previous work experiences have contributed to my interest in computer science education. 
	I have worked as a T.A. for a beginning programming class in Java, where I offered tutoring, reviewing sessions, and saw students improve up to 3 letter grades with my help. 
	Also, I have worked as the BitLab administrator at Meredith College, where I have had the freedom to provide a vision for our main computer science classroom in the hopes of encouraging
	more students to become interested in the major.&lt;/p&gt;
